Quick shout-out to Mark @ [idesine](https://www.idesine.com) for the tweet - this blog site was triggered by the new edition of ["Acorn - A World in Pixels - Extended Edition"](https://www.idesine.com/products/acorn-a-world-in-pixels-book-bbc-micro-acorn-electron-2nd-edition) when Mark requested an [interview](https://www.idesine.com/blogs/news/the-making-of-superior-softwares-vertigo) . . .

I was the co-author (with James) of "[Vertigo](http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=1080)" a game for the BBC Micro / BBC Master / Electron, released on "Play It Again Sam 16", published by Superior Software at the tail end of the 8-bit era - the results of learning 6502 assembler when in school and making a game for the fun of it in our spare time.

I hadn't realised the amount of interest in old BBC games, so have started dusting off old games and cassettes from the 1980's, with the aim of uploading the sources of Vertigo to GitHUb. Richard Hanson at Superior Software (now [Superior Interactive](https://www.superiorinteractive.com)) ok'd me releasing the code, so just down to isopropyl alcohol and de-moulding 5.25" floppy discs.

First mission is recovering the code for Robo-1, a type-in game I had published by [Computer & Video Games](https://archive.org/details/Computer_Video_Games_Issue_037_1984-11_EMAP_Publishing_GB), from cassette, then onto the floppy discs! :)
