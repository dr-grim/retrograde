Finally, now to use the [GOTEK](http://www.retroclinic.com/docs/GOTEKFloppyDrive.pdf) (as purchased from [RetroClinic](http://www.retroclinic.com)). I wanted to read from `TAPE` and store on the USB stick - in this case, a nice opportunity to use `ADFS` (all those years, I'd mostly used Opus DDOS - 720kb vs ADFS 640kb, that and its RAM disc..).

Initial challenge was - how to do it? There's a simple recipe, the manual way:

- `*TAPE`
- `LOAD ""`
- Press "play", and note the filename..
- `*ADFS`
- `SAVE "whatever"`
- ..and its now on the USB stick

Just need to select a suitable disc image in the GoTEK (an ADFS one in this case) - with sufficient space, of course. This meant that the `.ADF` file on the USB stick can then be read in on a PC/Mac and used with an emulator or just extracted as a data file for use natively.

To extract the data, I looked around, and found Jon Welch's [Mac ADFS Explorer](http://www.g7jjf.com/mac_adfs_explorer.htm) which meant my macbook would be useable as a dev tool. Suffice to say, one USB stick later - and the data (after 30+ years - nearer 40!) was now from cassette and onto far newer hardware. Proof of concept: tick!

However, this was pretty laborious - must be a quicker way. I looked around the web, and found a fair few utilities:
- `CopyFiles` - on the BBC Welcome Disc
- `CopyFiles` - updated at [Sprow's web pages](http://www.sprow.co.uk/bbc/bbcbasic.htm)
- `Disc Doctor` ROM - good thread on [StarDot](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3486)
- `TreeCopy` - from J.G.Harston @ [MDFS](https://mdfs.net/Software/FileTools/)

Now, all of these (alas) seem to bo focussed on DFS transfers - something I'll need later, but at the moment - I need a simple LOAD->SAVE utility. Can't seem to find one!

Time to roll up my sleeves then, and back to hacking BBC BASIC - but now with an internet to help me!
