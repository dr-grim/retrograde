The belts arrived, and out of the 50 supplied, a good bundle were the right size; I scraped clean the belt wheels, and fitted a new belt:

..and.. success! The spindles rotate! I quickly cleaned the pinch rollers (both) with isopropyl alcohol, also the read head -  let's play! Audio tapes sounded pretty good, so I plugged in data cassette. Sounded like only 1 channel was recorded (might have been "left") but nothing from the other. Time to try with the beeb, that will read from a mono jack plugged in to the stereo port.

Bingo! `Searching..` soon popped up the block counter; I was off! Next challenge - getting data from `TAPE` to `DISC`..
