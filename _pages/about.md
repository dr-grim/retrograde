Hi! I'm Ian Grimstead, I've written a few things for the BBC Micro "back in the day"; after a conversation about 8-bit coding, I realising how much interest is out there for old skool code. This blog aims to unearth (hopefully) interesting items from an archive of discs, manuals and (gasp) cassettes from the 1980's, mostly focussed on the BBC Micro. So slowly winding backwards.. retrograde..

More modern code & posts can be found in [prograde](https://iangrimstead.github.io/prograde/) which is related to Machine Learning & Computer Vision...
